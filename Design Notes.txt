Design Notes
------------

Board is powered from +12V DC from the Power_In header pins. The power supply must be able to provide at least 10 A.

The 40mm fan is 12v, 0.6 A. 
TEC is 12v, 9 A.
The temperature sensor suggested can't be submerged, replace with this sensor:

Relay is Normally Open, so it will turn on the TEC when it is energized. It's rated for 10A, and max current it should see is 9 A. 

When you program this, make sure Arduino Leonardo is selected in the Arduino IDE.
